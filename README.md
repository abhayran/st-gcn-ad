# Spatio-temporal graph convolutions

A project implementing spatio-temporal graph convolutions for multi-modal MRI classification. We extend the [*GraphSAGE*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf) architecture introduced by Hamilton et. al. to spatio-temporal convolutions by introducing small but effective modifications.  

This project is written in PyTorch using the library [*torch_geometric*](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) built for deep learning on graphs.
